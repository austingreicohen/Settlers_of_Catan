# Settlers of Catan Data Project

1. Dash Catan App: Creates dashboard of Settlers of Catan data through Plotly Dash. Hosted through Heroku at https://catandash614.herokuapp.com/

2. Catan Modelling: Comparison of Random Forest and Logistic Regression models for assessing the most important tracked features for Catan victory. Logistic Regression has a higher model accuracy, but both models are limited in their predictive power. Winning Longest Road is the main determinant of success, though this was expected given Longest Road gives the player 2 points toward victory.
